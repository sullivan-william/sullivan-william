Hi, my name is Will Sullivan. I am an aspiring full-stack software engineer. I have completed a bootcamp through NC State University for full-stack web development where I gained invaluable experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UX/UI, React, Express, APIs, SQL, Cybersecurity, and Python. I really love building on what I've learned so far by making my own websites and building on top of older projects. Currently looking for work as a web developer. You can reach me on my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-p-sullivan/
